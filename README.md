# AQI Analysis for Ripple Renewable Energy (RRE)

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

The **Air Quality Index (AQI)** is the Environmental Protection Agency's system for reporting air quality conditions across the United States. A value near **0** indicates minimal public health concern, while **higher AQI values** suggest increased health risks due to air pollution.

A proposed **federal policy** seeks to subsidize renewable energy in states where the **average AQI is 10 or above**. As part of your new role as a **Data Analyst** in the Strategy division at **Ripple Renewable Energy (RRE)**, your task is to assess how this policy might affect operations.

RRE currently operates in the following U.S. states:
- California
- Florida
- Michigan
- Ohio
- Pennsylvania
- Texas

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

Your manager has asked you to perform the following tasks:

1. **Summarize the mean AQI** for each of the six RRE states.
2. **Construct a boxplot** visualization of AQI values for these states using **Seaborn**.
3. **Evaluate** which state(s) may be most impacted by the policy, based on the data and your boxplot.
4. **Construct a 95% confidence interval** for the RRE state with the **highest average AQI**.
